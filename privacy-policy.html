    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 18, 2026</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This Privacy Policy explains how Cuisiner Autrement ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our service with Google OAuth2 authentication.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>At Cuisiner Autrement, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we handle your personal data when you use our application and authenticate through Google OAuth2, and tell you about your privacy rights.</p>

    <h2>2. OAuth2 Authentication with Google</h2>
    <p>Our application uses OAuth2, an industry-standard protocol for authorization, to authenticate users through their Google accounts. This method provides a secure way to access our services without sharing your password with us.</p>

    <h3>2.1 What is OAuth2?</h3>
    <p>OAuth2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that user account.</p>

    <h3>2.2 How Google OAuth2 Works in Our Application</h3>
    <p>When you choose to sign in with Google:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You are redirected to Google's secure authentication servers</li>
        <li>You log in with your Google credentials directly on Google's platform (we never see your password)</li>
        <li>You grant permission for our application to access specific information from your Google account</li>
        <li>Google provides us with an access token that allows our application to access only the authorized information</li>
        <li>We use this token to authenticate you and access the permitted data</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. Information We Collect Through Google OAuth2</h2>
    <p>When you authenticate with Google OAuth2, we may collect and process the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Profile Information:</strong> Your name, email address, profile picture, and Google user ID</li>
        <li><strong>Email Address:</strong> Used for account identification and communication</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Picture:</strong> Displayed in your account profile (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> OAuth2 access tokens and refresh tokens to maintain your session</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> We only request access to information that is necessary for our application to function. We do not have access to your Google password, and we cannot access other Google services on your behalf without your explicit permission.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information collected through Google OAuth2 for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account on our platform</li>
        <li>To authenticate and verify your identity</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience on our application</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your account and our services</li>
        <li>To improve our services and user experience</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms of service</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using SSL/TLS</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage:</strong> OAuth2 tokens are stored securely and encrypted</li>
        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We restrict access to personal information to authorized personnel only</li>
        <li><strong>Token Management:</strong> Access tokens have limited lifespans and are regularly refreshed</li>
        <li><strong>No Password Storage:</strong> We never store your Google password</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Google:</strong> As required by the OAuth2 protocol for authentication purposes</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our application (under strict confidentiality agreements)</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law, regulation, or legal process</li>
        <li><strong>Protection of Rights:</strong> To protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your personal information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal information we hold about you</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can update or correct your profile information at any time</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can request deletion of your account and associated data</li>
        <li><strong>Revoke Access:</strong> You can revoke our application's access to your Google account at any time through your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a> page</li>
        <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> You can request a copy of your data in a portable format</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>8. Revoking Access</h2>

        <li>Find "Cuisiner Autrement" in the list of connected apps</li>
        <li>Click "Remove Access"</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that revoking access will sign you out of our application, and you will need to re-authenticate if you wish to use our services again.</p>

    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you request deletion of your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal information within 30 days, except where we are required to retain it for legal purposes.</p>

If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will delete such information.</p>

    <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that are different from the laws of your country. We ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your information.</p>

    <h2>12. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to maintain your session and improve your experience. The OAuth2 authentication process may also use cookies to maintain your authentication state. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
